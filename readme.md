Currently very heavily work-in-progress, with barebones implementations of each feature.

### Features
- Take a quick glance at your most recent projects, and Edit, Run or Build them.
- Look up function help and usage notes for each of the GM82 extensions.
- Check for Updates and News from the Project.
